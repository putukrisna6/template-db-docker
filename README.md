# template-db-docker
MariaDB + phpMyAdmin with Docker Compose Template

Taken from my Go API project. Access it [here](https://github.com/putukrisna6/golang-api) if you are interested.

### phpMyAdmin
- access via `http://localhost:8085/` or through the "Open in Browser" in Docker Desktop
- by default: server is `db`, username is `root`, and password is `test`. configurable within `docker-compose.yml`
